## Are you safe?

`Are you safe?` is a project focused on fingerprinting and collecting every single bit of user data that it can. Such data range from User Agents to WebGL fingerprinting. Features include:

- IP grabbing through methods such as request logging and WebRTC leaks
- User fingerprinting like device and browser information (If possible)
- DNS leak test
